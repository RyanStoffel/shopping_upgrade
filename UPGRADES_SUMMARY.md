service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
                          && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
                          && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
